        You asked us “When can we buy a Eveeio?” and the answer is NOW! In this
        blog, we will give you a complete low-down on the buying process for a
        Wynn and answer all the possible queries around them. Yulu Wynn is a
        revolutionary electric vehicle that offers easy mobility to people of
        all ages. It is a digital-first EV that leverages technology to offer
        industry-first features like truly-keyless access and instant
        family-sharing. Not only that, Wynn is a Low Speed EV (LSEV). So it has
        many advantages of its own- like it doesn’t need registration or the
        rider to have a driving license, that a traditional vehicle wouldn’t
        have. So, who is Wynn for? Wynn is a personal mobility EV, custom-built
        by us, to make urban mobility seamless and suitable for all ages. Wynn
        is for everyone, be it a college going student, everyday rider, a
        homemaker, or an elderly rider. How can I book Wynn? You can pre-book
        Yulu Wynn through the Yulu app or online @ buy.yulu.bike. On the app&gt;
